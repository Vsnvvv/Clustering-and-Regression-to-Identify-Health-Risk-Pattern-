# Clustering-and-Regression-to-Identify-Health-Risk-Pattern-
# Health Risk Pattern Analysis using Clustering & Regression

## 📌 Project Summary
This project applies **data analytics and machine learning techniques** to identify health risk patterns in patient data. Using **K-Means clustering** and **Linear Regression**, the analysis explores relationships between plasma glucose, BMI, and diabetes risk indicators to support early identification of high-risk individuals.

The project demonstrates my ability to turn complex data into **clear insights** that can support decision-making in healthcare and performance-focused environments.
